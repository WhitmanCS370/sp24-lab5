_February 13, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-ch7: The code files for the _SDX Ch.7_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Jas + Luke

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Jas
* NAVIGATOR: Luke

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 7_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 7?

Compilers and interpreters are nothing special, just data and functions. The recursive element also shows how they work. The chapter works through examples to show this point.

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

The visual diagrams were confusing and did not help our understanding. Also not really sure what JSON files are and the chapter just kinda throws it out there. 

## Part 2 Documentation

We worked on bugfixing our part 1 code, and ended up making the problems worse.
